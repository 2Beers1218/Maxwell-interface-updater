  This repository consists of a modified version of the
  Maxwell Solver KirasFM, which is based on a fixed-point
  domain decomposition method and a feedforward neural
  network-enhanced that is used to compute an approximation
  of the surface operator occurring in the fixed point
  formulation of the Maxwell equation.
